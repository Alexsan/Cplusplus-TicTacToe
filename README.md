This the CPlusPlus program for tictactoe developed using techniques observed from code snippets from the ff. sources:

This code implements the minimax algorithm used in some games where turn-based decisions are influenced by minimizing the loss by running scenarios.                                  
For more on minimax, please refer to this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax                                  
The game has 2 modes: VS AI and VS Human Player I used Visual Studio as my compiler although I believe any CPlusPlus compiler would do.                                  
Enjoy and if you can send me some feedback about the game, please do.
